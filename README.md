Hello, my name is Aviv

I am a Senior Software Engineer at *Lusha*,    
where I'm working on large scale contact enrichment pipelines.

Before joining Lusha, I worked at Tomorrow.io and Innovid.

I've designed and implemented multiple cloud-native AI architectures for various industries using various technology stacks and programming languages.
I see Code as a form of expressing art, clean code advocate, 
simplicity over complexity, aspiring for pure, elegant efficient programs.
